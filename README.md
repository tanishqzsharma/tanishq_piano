In this project, I've created a GUI piano by using different libraries of Python. With the help of the tkinter library, GUI for the project was created. As the name suggests, several keynotes of the piano are there and by clicking them the sound will get produced accordingly. For playing the sound I've used the mixer module of the pygame library.
